AI Overview
A .gitignore file for a Go project typically focuses on excluding compiled binaries, test artifacts, and editor/IDE-specific files.
Here is a comprehensive .gitignore for a Go project:
Code

# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binary, built with `go test -c`
*.test

# Output of the go coverage tool, specifically when used with LiteIDE
*.out

# Dependency directories (vendor directory is often included in version control for Go projects,
# but if you manage dependencies differently, you might uncomment this)
# vendor/

# Go module cache
.gocache/

# Build output directory (if you use a specific output directory like 'bin')
bin/

# IDE/Editor specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.bak
